# The Mission #
|"Enable anyone to quickly, easily and freely create and self-publish their own story-based games and content to the world from within an empowered community."|
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This statement reflects our vision for the users and community.  All planned features and community ventures should be tested against this vision.

A breakdown of what this mission statement means is as follows.
<br />

## "Enable anyone to quickly, easily and freely create..." ##

Making games seems daunting to most folk and this reputation is largely well-deserved. The downside to game development is that it's difficult, expensive, burdensome and often just plain tedious.

Our "story game" creation tool exists to lower the barrier for entry and open up a new avenue of self-expression to all those who previously lacked the skill, money, time or patience. We want anyone to feel they can get involved and become creators in a flash.

## "and self-publish their own story-based games and content" ##

self-publish...  Individual creators of RPExpress games and content should be the ones who publish their work and are thus eligible to reap the rewards.  Over time, the success of individual creators will flow on to the RPExpress community as a reputation outside the community is made.

We want people to be able to market and distribute their own games to popular digital marketplaces.  One of the purposes of the community is to assist creators in doing this.  The secondary goal is to create a reputation for the RPExpress community so that future community members can more easily self-publish their work.

story-based games...

content... Maybe only want to create some content, not a full game

RPG-like games with content e.g., textures, voice-over, etc. Creators will eventually be able to produce an executable for many platforms. **Can creators sell their games?**



## "to the world" ##

Creators should be driven by the possibility that the world might one day see their work.

The community should always be trying to push its member's creations into the mainstream.

## "from within an empowered community." ##

Budding creators should always feel connected, supported and inspired by an active community.

With multiple skills required to produce all of the content for games in general, collaboration by a community is required to help individual creators express their unique visions successfully.

Few people either excel at everything or fail at everything. It's important that each community member finds and develops their strengths while being pushed by the community to branch out and gain new expertise.

The community also continuously explores and decides upon new directions that keep this mission moving forward.
